    <p>Heyo, I'm Claire, and this is my homepage. Sometimes I do things on the internet and this website is probably the best way to find and keep up with that.</p>

    <hr/>
    <p><span class="small">2022.12.18</span>Today I made this website! Corporate social media sucks and with Twitter blocking things like Linktree, now seemed the prefect time to finally get this up and running.</p>
    <p>I probably won't update this super often, but lately I've been trying to learn more about music production, in addition to my usual excessive anime-watching.</p>
    <p>I at least know enough about SynthV to have made an info site about it (<a href="https://synthv.info">synthv.info</a>), so that's pretty neat. I hope I can expand that knowledge to include other engines like Vocaloid and CeVIO.</p>
